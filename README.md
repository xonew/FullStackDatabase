# CPSC 304 Project Repository

The aim of this database is to track player progress for a generic gacha game. This project will support future gacha game creation by providing a complete framework for any gacha game project. As well, it should also provide the ability for an administrator to edit player data manually, as well as store object information, such as items and characters so that the game can retrieve the data and display the information.

This is a well-desgined full-stack developement project, we use Javascript and React for the front end, and node, express to interact with oracle based databse on the backend.
