# CPSC 304 Project Repository: MMORPG Database

The aim of this database is to track player progress for a generic MMORPG. This project will support MMO creation by providing a framework datahase for any online game project. As well, it should also provide the ability for an administrator to edit player data manually, as well as store object information, such as items and characters, so that the game can retrieve the data and display the information.

This is a full-stack developement project using Javascript and HTML on the front end and Node.js, Express, and MySql on the back end. All run in Docker containers for ease of use.
